# Forecasting NBA total game scores
## Overview
Using historical NBA game data for the past four seasons for every game up until the Covid-19 hiatus, the game totals were forecasted using numerous variables like Team Offensive Rating and Team Defensive Rating, to name a couple. This was then compared to the actual betting line for each game to analyze the accuracy of each prediction. The ultimate goal of this project was to use this model to predict upcoming games and give insightful information for betting on the total score of an upcoming game.

The files that are included in this repository are the two csv files where I stored the historical game data and the historical betting data, the R file containg the raw code to build the model, the PDF file containing my rough draft in RMarkdown, and my final report.
